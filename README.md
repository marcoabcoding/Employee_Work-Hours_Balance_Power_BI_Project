Project Overview

This repository hosts a Power BI dashboard designed to track and visualize employee work hours, focusing on overtime and deficits in required work hours. Given Power BI's limitation with negative time values, this project introduces a novel solution by converting all time units to minutes, thereby enabling accurate calculations and visualizations of employees' hours using DAX.
Features

Time Conversion: Utilizes a method to convert hours and minutes into minutes to handle negative time values effectively.
DAX Formulas: Custom DAX formulas for precise calculation and display of time data in Power BI.
Visualization: Offers a comprehensive dashboard showing average, maximum, and minimum time balances, along with a detailed breakdown for each employee.
Indicator Legends: Incorporates legends to distinguish between positive and negative time balances for easy interpretation.
